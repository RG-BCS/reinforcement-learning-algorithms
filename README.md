# Reinforcement Learning Algorithms

This repository is a curated collection of **foundational reinforcement learning (RL) algorithms**, all implemented **from scratch** using only **Python and NumPy** — no TensorFlow, PyTorch, or Stable-Baselines.

> The goal is to deeply understand RL by manually building its core algorithms, step by step.

## 📌 What’s Inside

Each implementation is clean, minimal, and modular — great for learning, interview prep, or building up your conceptual muscle in RL.

### ✅ Tabular & Classic RL
- **Monte Carlo Methods**
- **TD(0)**
- **SARSA & Q-Learning**
- **Value Iteration / Policy Iteration**
- **MDP Solvers**
- **GridWorld** (with and without obstacles)

### 🧠 Policy Gradient Family
- **Vanilla Policy Gradient (REINFORCE)**
- **Actor-Critic**
- **Advantage Normalization**
- **PG with Baselines**

### 🔁 Deep Reinforcement Learning
- **DQN**
- **Target Networks**
- **Experience Replay**
- **DQN Variants** (e.g. Double DQN, Dueling)

### 🧪 Environments Covered
- `GridWorld` (custom)
- `CartPole-v1`
- `LunarLander-v2`

## 🧭 Project Goals

- Understand RL algorithms by reimplementing them from first principles  
- Avoid deep learning abstraction layers (like Keras or Torch) to focus on core math  
- Build a personal reference for interviews, research, and teaching others  
- Keep code educational, clean, and easy to read
