# Reinforcement Learning Algorithms

This repository contains a curated collection of fundamental and deep reinforcement learning algorithms implemented using **Python**, **NumPy**, and industry-standard frameworks like **TensorFlow** and **PyTorch**.

The goal is to deeply understand the theory and practice of RL — from **tabular methods** to **deep function approximation** — by building everything from scratch, with minimal reliance on high-level RL libraries.
